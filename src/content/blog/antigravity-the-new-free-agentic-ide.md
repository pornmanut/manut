# Antigravity: The New Free Agentic IDE

I just tried out Google's new **Antigravity IDE**, and honestly? It's kind of insane.

## The Agentic Shift

We've all been using AI assistants like Copilot or Cursor, right? They're great for auto-complete or chatting about code. But Antigravity feels different. It's built from the ground up as an "agentic development platform."

What does that mean? It means you're not just typing code; you're managing agents. You tell it, "Refactor this entire component to use the new API," and it just... goes and does it. It's powered by **Gemini 3**, which seems to have a massive context window and understands the whole codebase really well.

## Why I'm Excited

### 1. It's Actually Free (For Now)
Google is releasing this for free for individual developers. No subscription, no credit card. They have "generous rate limits," which is perfect for hobbyists and indie devs like us.

### 2. It Feels Familiar
If you're coming from VS Code (which, let's be real, most of us are), you'll feel right at home. It looks and feels very similar, so you don't have to relearn muscle memory. But then you have these powerful AI agents living in the sidebar.

### 3. It's Not Just Text
It can control the browser, run terminal commands, and verify its own work. It feels like pair programming with a really fast, really smart junior dev who never gets tired.

## Should You Switch?

Look, I know switching IDEs is a pain. But if you want to see where the future of coding is going, you have to try this. It's available now for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

I'm going to be playing around with it more and will probably write a deep dive on how to build a full app with it soon. Stay tuned!
