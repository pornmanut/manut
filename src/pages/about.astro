					Hey, I'm Vanilas! I'm a software developer who's pretty damn tired of the routine job grind and looking to break into game development.

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary font-serif">What I'm Into</h2>
				<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground mb-4">
					I'm really interested in politics, social issues, world history, and game theory - basically anything related to power dynamics and how systems work. I love digging into the real mechanics of control, influence, and money, not just the bullshit they teach in textbooks.
				</p>
				<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground">
					I love playing games, especially adult games that push boundaries. Gaming isn't just entertainment - it's a way to explore different realities and experience power dynamics safely. From strategy games to RPGs, I'm here for all of it.

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary font-serif">My Creative Side</h2>
				<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground">
					In my routine, I spend a lot of time generating images with Stable Diffusion on my fucking local computer. I train my own LoRA models on them and do hands-on image editing myself. I'm not just some asshole who clicks buttons on AI tools - I actually want to use AI to enhance my skills, not replace them.

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary font-serif">What This Blog Is About</h2>
				<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-foreground">
					I'll mainly be sharing stuff I actually do in real life - like coding projects, random ideas that pop into my head, or thoughts about world politics, fucking trade, money, or life in general.

					If you find what I share interesting or want to chat about similar stuff, stick around. Let's see where this journey goes.
